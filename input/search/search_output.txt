3.201737 -1892196197 roper In other cases, however, the vaccine recipient may have suffered an injury not of the type covered in the Vaccine Injury Table.
3.201737 -257198421 roper In some cases, the petitioner may simply demonstrate the occurrence of what has been called a "Table Injury."
3.152784 548413287 roper That is, it may be shown that the vaccine recipient suffered an injury of the type enumerated in the ?Vaccine Injury Table? corresponding to the vaccination in question, within an applicable time period also specified in the Table.
3.152784 956198945 roper In general, to gain an award, a petitioner must make a number of factual demonstrations, including showings that an individual received a vaccination covered by the statute; received it in the United States; suffered a serious long-lasting injury; and has received no previous award or settlement on account of the injury.
3.103831 488575179 roper Thus, the petitioner must supply ?proof of a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury;? the logical sequence must be supported by ?reputable medical or scientific explanation, i.e., by evidence in the form of scientific studies or expert medical testimony.?
3.0548782 708999375 roper That is, the petitioner may gain an award by showing that the recipient?s injury was ?caused-in-fact? by the vaccination in question.
3.0548782 1073788786 roper If so, the Table Injury is presumed to have been caused by the vaccination, and the petitioner is automatically entitled to compensation, unless it is shown affirmatively that the injury was caused by some factor other than the vaccination.
3.0548782 -670775355 roper The petitioner need not show that the vaccination was the sole cause or even the predominant cause of the injury or condition, but must demonstrate that the vaccination was at least a ?substantial factor? in causing the condition, and was a ?but for? cause.
3.0548782 -1154403462 roper The burden is on the petitioner to introduce evidence demonstrating that, in fact, the vaccination caused the injury in question.
